description: "Pulls the .claude folder (commands and skills), plus the scripts outside it that they run, from Nathan's project-template repo into the current repo (a project scaffolded from that template), with a file-by-file diff and confirmation before anything is overwritten.

Trigger this whenever Nathan says '/sync-from-template', asks to sync, pull, or update commands, skills, or tooling from the template, says the template has newer tooling than this repo, asks to catch up on a breaking template change, mentions migrating a repo to a new template version, asks to check this repo against project-template, or wants to catch up on template changes -- even if he does not name the skill. This is the mirror image of the /sync-template command, which audits a repo's internal consistency with itself. This skill instead reaches OUT from a downstream project repo back to the template to pull specific folders in. Do not use this for auditing a repo's own internal folder, README, or CLAUDE.md consistency -- that is a separate concern handled by the /sync-template command."

# Sync from template

## What this does

Reaches from the current repo (a project created from `project-template`) back to
the template repo, and pulls its current `.claude` folder — commands and
skills — in. Every file that differs is shown as a diff and held for confirmation before
it touches anything on disk. Nothing is overwritten silently.

Some of those commands run scripts that live outside `.claude/` — `/roadmap`
runs `scripts/check_roadmap.sh`, `/sync-template` runs
`scripts/validate_skills.sh`. The template lists exactly those files in
[`tooling_paths.txt`](tooling_paths.txt), and they are offered alongside
`.claude/` under the same diff-and-confirm rules. Nothing else outside
`.claude/` is ever touched.

It also reads the changelog gap between this project's `.template-version`
and the template's current one. A breaking (Major) release can require more
than new files — deleting something, or editing a file the normal sync
doesn't touch — and those get proposed as their own batch, held for their
own confirmation, same as everything else here.

## When to use this

Run it when Nathan:

- Asks to sync, pull, or update commands, skills, or tooling from the template
- Says the template has picked up new commands, skills, or `CLAUDE.md` changes
- Wants to check whether this repo is behind `project-template`
- Types `/sync-from-template`

Do not confuse this with the `/sync-template` command. That command audits a
repo's own internal consistency — folders vs. READMEs, documented commands vs.
reality — without reaching outside it. This skill reaches from a *downstream*
project repo back to the template and pulls a folder in. Different direction,
different job.

## One-time setup: the config file

The first time this runs in a repo, look for `.claude/sync-from-template.yaml`.
If it does not exist, this is a first run: propose the defaults below (this is
Nathan's one template repo, so the URL and branch are already known), let him
confirm or override, and create the file.

```yaml
# .claude/sync-from-template.yaml
# Fill in once, when this repo is set up. Committed to the repo so it travels
# with clones and doesn't live only in one machine's git config.
template_repo_url: https://github.com/TeamCastaldi/project-template.git
template_ref: main
sync_paths:
  - .claude
```

> [!NOTE]
> This repo does not currently record its template origin anywhere else (e.g.
> in `CLAUDE.md`). If `init-project` starts doing that later, read that value
> first and treat this file as the fallback -- don't ask Nathan to duplicate
> the same URL in two places once there's a single source of truth for it.

Proposing the default above on first run is fine -- it's a known, confirmed
value, not a guess. If Nathan ever points this skill at a different template
repo, or the default above stops being accurate, don't invent a replacement
URL; stop and ask.

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch and compare

Run [`scripts/compare_template.sh`](scripts/compare_template.sh) with the
values from the config file:

```bash
scripts/compare_template.sh "$TEMPLATE_REPO_URL" "$TEMPLATE_REF" "$PROJECT_ROOT" "${SYNC_PATHS[@]}"
```

This does an ephemeral sparse clone of the template (shallow, blob-filtered,
scoped to `sync_paths` only) into a temp directory, then reports how every
file under those paths compares to the local repo. It never touches the local
repo itself -- it only reads and reports. Read
[`scripts/compare_template.sh`](scripts/compare_template.sh) itself if you
need to understand exactly what it does before running it; it is short and
worth reading rather than trusting blindly.

The script's output gives you four buckets per file: `NEW`, `CHANGED`, `SAME`,
`LOCAL_ONLY`. It also prints `TEMP_CLONE=<path>` (where the fetched template
copy lives) and `TEMPLATE_SHA=<short sha>` (the commit you're comparing
against). Keep both of these -- you need them for the rest of the workflow.

It also prints `TOOLING_PATHS=`: the files outside `sync_paths` that the
template's `tooling_paths.txt` added to the comparison, or `none`. They land in
the same four buckets, and are diffed and copied from `$TEMP_CLONE` exactly like
a `.claude/` file. The list is read from the *template*, so it is always the
template's current idea of what its commands need -- never add a path to
`sync_paths` to get a script; add it to the template's list instead, and every
downstream project picks it up.

**No `TOOLING_PATHS=` line at all** means this project's own copy of
`compare_template.sh` predates the list. This sync will offer the newer script
as `CHANGED`; once it has been pulled, run step 1 again before reporting done,
so the tooling files are offered in the same session rather than silently
waiting for the next one. Say that is what you are doing.

It also prints `TEMPLATE_VERSION` and `PROJECT_VERSION`, read from each side's
`.template-version`. These turn the report from a raw file diff into a
statement of how far behind this project is:

- **Both known and different** -- name the gap (`1.4.0 -> 2.1.0`) and read
  `CHANGELOG.md` from `$TEMP_CLONE` for the entries between them (it's a
  root-level file, present even though `sync_paths` only lists `.claude`).
  A **Major** entry means a downstream project is expected to act by hand, so
  surface those before showing any file diffs: they explain *why* files
  changed, which is the thing a file-by-file diff cannot tell anyone. See
  "Migration steps" below for turning these into proposed actions rather than
  just prose to read.
- **Both known and equal** -- say so. Any `CHANGED` file is then a local edit,
  not an upstream update, and that is worth pointing out rather than offering to
  overwrite.
- **`PROJECT_VERSION=unknown`** -- this project predates template versioning.
  Offer to write the current `TEMPLATE_VERSION` into `.template-version` as part
  of this sync, so the next run can report a real gap.
- **`TEMPLATE_VERSION=unknown`** -- the pinned ref predates versioning. Fall back
  to the SHA and say that is what you are comparing against.

We use an ephemeral clone rather than a persistent `template` git remote on
purpose: the only thing that needs to know where the template lives is the
config file above. If the template ever moves, Nathan changes one YAML value
and every future sync just picks it up, instead of having to also update a
remote URL that isn't tracked anywhere. This does mean a fresh clone on every
run instead of an incremental fetch -- if that ever becomes slow enough to be
annoying, a persistent remote is the fallback; revisit then.

### 2. Report

Present the comparison grouped by status, in this format:

```text
TEMPLATE SYNC REPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Comparing against project-template @ <template_ref> (commit <sha>)
Version: <PROJECT_VERSION> -> <TEMPLATE_VERSION>

🔧 Migration steps: [see below -- parsed from Major entries, or "none"]
🧰 Tooling:          [TOOLING_PATHS, or "none" -- their status is in the rows below]
✅ Up to date:       [files marked SAME]
🔄 Changed upstream: [files marked CHANGED]
➕ New in template:  [files marked NEW]
❓ Local-only:       [files marked LOCAL_ONLY -- never auto-removed]
```

Drop the version line if both sides are `unknown`. If there are no Major
entries between the two versions, the migration row just says "none" -- don't
drop the row entirely, since its absence reads differently than a confirmed
"nothing to do."

If every file is `SAME` and there are no migration steps, say so plainly and
stop -- there's nothing to confirm or apply.

### Migration steps

For each Major changelog entry between `PROJECT_VERSION` and
`TEMPLATE_VERSION`, look for a `### Migration steps` heading (a sibling of
`### Added` / `### Changed`) and read its bullets. A Major entry with no such
heading is not silently skipped -- show its prose as a manual note ("no
automated action; read this and act by hand") and move on. Never infer a
`DELETE` or `EDIT` action from prose that isn't in that exact list; guessing
at a deletion is exactly the failure mode this convention exists to avoid.

Concatenate the lists from every Major entry in the gap, in version order.
For each action, check the project's current state before proposing anything:

- `DELETE <path>` -- if the path doesn't exist in the project, it's already
  done; don't list it as pending.
- `EDIT <path>: <target state>` -- read the file and judge whether the
  described state already holds. If it does, it's already done. If not, work
  out the specific change and have it ready to show.

Present the result:

```text
MIGRATION STEPS (<PROJECT_VERSION> -> <TEMPLATE_VERSION>)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Already done: [actions whose target state already holds]

⏳ Pending:
  1. DELETE <path>            (<n> files, if a directory)
  2. EDIT <path> -- <one-line summary of the change>
     [the actual diff or content to insert, shown in full]

Reply SYNC: MIGRATE to apply everything under Pending.
```

`SYNC: MIGRATE` is a single confirmation for the whole pending batch, not
per-item -- but every pending item is shown in full above it first, so that
one reply is an informed one, not a blind one. Never split it into individual
prompts; that's what `SYNC: PULL <path>` is for on the file side, and the two
mechanisms stay separate on purpose (a migration action can delete something;
a file pull never does).

To apply a pending `DELETE`, remove the path. To apply a pending `EDIT`, make
the change you showed -- for the CLAUDE.md Session Config case, that means
copying the table out of `$TEMP_CLONE/CLAUDE.md` verbatim rather than
retyping it.

### 3. Confirm and apply, one file at a time

For each `CHANGED` file, show a real diff before asking for anything:

```bash
diff -u "$PROJECT_ROOT/$rel" "$TEMP_CLONE/$rel"
```

For each `NEW` file, show its content (it's new, there's nothing to diff
against).

Wait for one of these before touching disk:

- `SYNC: PULL <path>` -- apply that one file
- `SYNC: PULL ALL` -- apply every `CHANGED` and `NEW` file reported

To apply a file, copy it from the temp clone over the local path, creating
parent directories if the file is new:

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$PROJECT_ROOT/$rel")"
cp "$TEMP_CLONE/$rel" "$PROJECT_ROOT/$rel"
```

`LOCAL_ONLY` files are report-only. Never delete, move, or modify them,
regardless of what confirmation phrase Nathan gives -- there is no phrase
that authorizes touching them. If a file only exists locally, that's either
intentional local customization or something the template dropped; either
way it needs a human to look at it deliberately, not this skill deciding on
its behalf.

### 4. Stamp the version

Once at least one file has been applied, at least one migration step has been
applied, or every pending item was already-done, write the template version
this sync brought the project up to:

```bash
echo "$TEMPLATE_VERSION" > "$PROJECT_ROOT/.template-version"
```

Do this only when `TEMPLATE_VERSION` is not `unknown`. A project that
declined every change is still on its old version, and a marker claiming
otherwise makes the next sync report a gap that does not exist -- worse than
having no marker at all.

If Nathan applied only some of the `CHANGED` files, or only some of the
pending migration steps, say so and ask before stamping: the version is a
claim about the whole synced tree, and a partial apply does not support it.

### 5. Clean up

Once Nathan is done applying changes (or decides not to apply any), remove
the temp clone:

```bash
rm -rf "$TEMP_CLONE"
```

This is safe to run without asking first -- `$TEMP_CLONE` is a directory this
skill created a few minutes ago under `mktemp -d`, not anything of Nathan's.

### 6. Suggest a commit

Once at least one file was applied, suggest (don't run) a commit:

```text
chore(tooling): sync .claude and tooling from project-template@<short-sha>
```

When a version was stamped, name it instead -- it means more to a reader six
months out than a short SHA does:

```text
chore(tooling): sync tooling from project-template 1.4.0 -> 2.1.0
```

## Boundaries

- Never invent `template_repo_url` -- ask if the config file doesn't have it.
- Never overwrite a `CHANGED` or apply a `NEW` file without an explicit
  `SYNC: PULL` confirmation for it.
- Never touch a `LOCAL_ONLY` file. Ever. That's out of scope for this skill,
  not just gated behind a confirmation phrase.
- Never pull a path outside `sync_paths` unless the template's
  `tooling_paths.txt` names it. A script sitting next to a listed one is not
  listed -- `scripts/` also holds files that only belong upstream, and
  offering those would undo what `init-project` deliberately removed.
- Never delete or edit anything as a "migration step" unless it's named,
  verbatim, in a `### Migration steps` list in `CHANGELOG.md`. A Major entry
  without that heading is shown as text, never turned into an action.
- Never apply a pending migration action without `SYNC: MIGRATE`.
- Never leave a temp clone behind after the sync is done or abandoned.
