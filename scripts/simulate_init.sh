#
# Builds a copy of this template transformed the way init-project's phases say
# to transform it, for a given project shape. The result is fed to
# check_scaffolded_project.sh, so CI can answer a question nothing else does:
# would a fresh clone, taken through the documented steps, come out clean?
#
# This is a fixture builder, not a reimplementation of the skill. It performs
# the mechanical edits the phases specify — filling placeholders, writing the
# founding brief, seeding an ADR, removing the template's own changelog — and
# deliberately nothing that needs judgement. If the two disagree, the skill is
# the source of truth and this script is what needs updating.
#
# Keeping it honest: the value here is that the verifier is a real, shippable
# check run on real projects too, not a test-only mirror. A simulation that
# drifts still cannot make the verifier accept a broken project.
#
# Usage:

#
#   shape   python-cli | ts-web
#   dest    directory to create; must not already exist

# which is precisely the file most likely to be wrong. That produced a green run
# locally and a red one in CI, where the same file was committed and therefore
# visible. Reading the working tree rather than `git archive HEAD` keeps an
# uncommitted fix testable; in CI the two agree, since the runner checks out the

$PROJECT_NAME needed a stack settled before any code was written.

## Decision

$ADR_BODY

## Consequences

The choice is load-bearing for every module written from here on. Revisiting it
after the first release would mean rewriting the entry points.

## The Problem

$BLURB

## The Solution

What gets built, and how it addresses the problem.

## The User

Small teams who need this without standing up more infrastructure.

## What We Are Not Building

Anything outside the scope above.

## Success Metric

Not yet defined — revisit before first release.

## Open Questions

None recorded during scaffolding.
