# Scripts

Dev-time utilities that support development but are not part of the shipped product. Scripts here are tools for the developer, not the application.

## What belongs here

- Environment setup helpers
- Data import/export utilities
- Local development conveniences (reset DB, generate test data, etc.)
- Build or deployment helpers that don't belong in CI
- One-off migration or cleanup scripts (keep even after use — they document what was done)

## What does not belong here

- Application code (that goes in backend/)
- Test files (those go in tests/)
- CI/CD pipeline definitions (those go in .github/workflows/)

## What is already here

These ship with the repo and are run by CI. Each has a header block explaining its checks, output format, and exit codes.

| Script | Checks |
|---|---|
| `validate_skills.sh` | Every `.claude/skills/*/` has a correctly named `SKILL.md` with valid frontmatter, and no stray packaged `.skill` archive |
| `check_doc_claims.sh` | Claims the root docs make — ecosystems, manifest filenames, script paths — resolve against what the repo actually contains |
| `check_scaffolded_project.sh` | A repo satisfies every post-condition `init-project` promises: no placeholders, `docs/foundation.md` present, ADRs indexed and linked, no template-only file left behind |
| `check_roadmap.sh` | A roadmap's checklist items: inventories each with its line and section, and flags items with no `source:`, a cited path that is gone, an unticked item whose deliverable already exists, or a ticked one whose deliverable does not. Run by `/roadmap` |
| `simulate_init.sh` | Not a check — builds an as-if-initialized fixture so CI can verify scaffolding end to end |

Each has a `test_*.sh` beside it. Run the tests before changing one; several of these checks look like they pass when they are silently doing nothing.

## Conventions

- Name scripts clearly: `reset-db.py`, `seed-dev-data.sh`, `export-users.ps1`
- Include a docstring or comment block at the top of each script explaining what it does, when to use it, and any required environment variables
- Cross-platform where possible — if a script is Windows-only or Linux-only, say so at the top
- Never hardcode secrets — read from environment variables or .env
